-- PART 1: BUILD YOUR MUSIC DATABASE
-- ============================================
CREATE DATABASE music_homework;

-- ============================================
-- SECTION 1: Create Core Tables
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 1.1: Create the albums table
-- Create a table called 'albums' with the following columns:
-- - id: Auto-incrementing primary key
-- - title: Text up to 255 characters, required
-- - release_year: Whole number, required, must be between 1900 and 2030
-- - duration_minutes: Whole number, must be positive
-- - sales_millions: Decimal number with 2 decimal places, cannot be negative
-- - rating: Decimal number with 1 decimal place, must be between 0 and 10
-- - created_at: Timestamp, automatically set to current time when row is created
--
-- Hint: Use SERIAL for auto-increment, CHECK constraints for validations, DEFAULT for automatic values
CREATE TABLE albums(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	release_year INTEGER CHECK (release_year >= 1900 and release_year <= 2030),
	duration_minutes INTEGER CHECK (duration_minutes > 0),
	sales_millions DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (sales_millions >= 0),
	rating DECIMAL(3, 1) CHECK (rating >= 0 and rating <= 10),
	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	birth_year INTEGER CHECK (birth_year >= 1900 and birth_year <= 2020),
	country VARCHAR(100),
	genre_speciality VARCHAR(100)
);


-- Exercise 1.3: Create the songs table
-- Create a table called 'songs' with:
-- - id: Auto-incrementing primary key
-- - title: Text up to 255 characters, required
-- - duration_seconds: Whole number, must be positive
-- - track_number: Whole number, must be positive
-- - album_id: Whole number (optional for now, we'll link it to albums later)
CREATE TABLE songs(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	duration_seconds INTEGER CHECK (duration_seconds > 0),
	track_number INTEGER CHECK (track_number > 0),

-- Exercise 1.5: Verify your tables
-- Write a query to list all tables you just created (should show: albums, artists, songs, genres)
--
-- Hint: Query information_schema.tables, filter by table_schema = 'public'
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- ============================================
-- SECTION 2: ALTER TABLE Practice
-- ============================================

-- Exercise 2.1: Add a column to albums
-- Add a column called 'label' to the albums table that can hold up to 150 characters of text
ALTER TABLE albums
ADD COLUMN label VARCHAR(150);


-- Exercise 2.2: Add a column with a default value
-- Add a column called 'is_explicit' to the albums table
-- This should be a true/false value that defaults to false
ALTER TABLE albums
ADD COLUMN is_explicit BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;


-- Exercise 2.3: Add a column to artists
-- Add a column called 'is_active' to the artists table
-- This should be a true/false value that defaults to true
ALTER TABLE artists
ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;


-- Exercise 2.4: Modify a column
-- The duration_seconds column in the songs table currently requires a value
-- Change it to allow NULL values (optional)
--
-- Hint: Use ALTER COLUMN with DROP NOT NULL
ALTER TABLE songs
ALTER COLUMN duration_seconds DROP NOT NULL;


-- Exercise 2.5: Rename a column
-- Rename the 'label' column in the albums table to 'record_label'
ALTER TABLE albums
RENAME COLUMN label TO record_label;


-- ============================================

LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;


-- ============================================
-- SECTION 4: Create Relationship Tables
-- ============================================
-- ⚠️ COMPLETE THIS SECTION AFTER SESSION OCT 28TH (JOINs session)

-- - artist_id must reference the id column in the artists table
-- - When an album is deleted, automatically delete related rows in this table
-- - When an artist is deleted, automatically delete related rows in this table
--
-- Hint: Use composite PRIMARY KEY (album_id, artist_id), FOREIGN KEY with ON DELETE CASCADE
CREATE TABLE album_artists (
    album_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    artist_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (album_id, artist_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE song_artists (
    song_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    artist_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (song_id, artist_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (song_id) REFERENCES songs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- - genre_id: Whole number, required
--
-- Constraints:
-- - The combination of album_id and genre_id should be the primary key
-- - album_id must reference albums table with cascade delete
-- - genre_id must reference genres table with cascade delete
CREATE TABLE album_genres (
    album_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    genre_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (album_id, genre_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (genre_id) REFERENCES genres(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

    review_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    helpful_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (helpful_count >= 0),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);


-- Exercise 4.5: Add foreign key to songs table
-- Remember when we created the songs table, we added an album_id column but didn't link it yet?
-- Now add a foreign key constraint to link songs.album_id to the albums table
-- Name the constraint 'fk_songs_album'
-- When an album is deleted, automatically delete its songs
--
-- Hint: Use ALTER TABLE...ADD CONSTRAINT...FOREIGN KEY
ALTER TABLE songs
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_songs_album
FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
